Bare-bones LMU (RPG Maker 2000/2003's map format) reader
========================================================

A basic reader for the map format of RPG Maker 2000 in C.

If you need something serious, you probably need EasyRPG's liblcf.
Or, if you need to do some processing, you can use EasyRPG's **lcf2xml**
utility and work with the XML.
